// Declaretion is to giving a name to a variable or definig it for very first time
//there are three types of declaration
//1. const: it can be declared once and once it can be initialized
//2. let: it can be declared once... its data type is fixed but we can change its value
//3. var: it can be redeclared or reinitialized
//examples:  
const x=10;
let y=10;
y=15; //vailid
// y="ram"; not vailid
var z=10;
z=15;
z="ram";
