first we gave an alert for what we are going to do in this perticular section. 
take value of n from user
define a variable sum
for loop a variable i with initial value 1
till n with incriment of 1
iteration 1:
i=1;
sum=0+1=1
i=i+1;
means i=2;
iteration 2:
i=2;
sum=1+2=3;
i=i+1;
means i=3;
sum=3+3=6;
and so on.... till i=n;
loop is over now
print sum;
