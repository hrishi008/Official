first we gave an alert for what we are going to do in this perticular section. 
take value from user
for loop a variable i with initial value 1
till n with incriment of 1
iteration 1:
i=1;
print i=1;
i=i+1;
means i=2;
iteration 2:
i=2;
print i=2;
i=i+1;
means i=3;
and so on.... till i=n=25;
print i=25
loop is over
