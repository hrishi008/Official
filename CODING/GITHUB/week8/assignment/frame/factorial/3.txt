first we gave an alert for what we are going to do in this perticular section. 
take value of n from user
define a variable fact
for loop a variable i with initial value 1
till n with incriment of 1
Aand apply fact=fact*i;
iteration 1:
i=1;
fact=1*1=1
i=i*1;
means i=1;
iteration 2:
i=2;
fact=1*2=2;
i=i*1;
means i=3;
fact=3*3=6;
and so on.... till i=n;
loop is over now
print fact;
